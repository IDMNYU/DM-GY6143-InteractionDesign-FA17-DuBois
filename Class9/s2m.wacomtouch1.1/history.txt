 
v1.1 (june 2014):

    - the former 0-1 mode has been renamed 'logical' and a new '0-1' mode has been added, 
      which will allways give 0-1 coordinates, even on screen tablets.

    - fixed a finger index issue and replaced the abstraction 'recycleFingersIDs.maxpat'
      by the javascript 's2m.recycleFingersIDs.js'

v1 : first release, with 64b support.
 
beta 4 :
    workaround for a wacom driver issue : when a finger was added to a tablet,
    its addition was reported several time. we now filter that.
